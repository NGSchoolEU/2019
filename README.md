# Materials for #NGSchool2019 - Machine Learning for Biomedicine

You will find here the materials for workshops, hackathons and lectures at the #NGSchool2019, together with installation directions and tips for running the software necessary for participation in the NGSchool2019.

## General instructions

### Conda
Put the Conda instructions here.

### Colab
[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) is an online service in which you can run jupyter notebooks (and even use some limited GPU!) It comes with some preloaded libraries which makes it easier to teach and run tutorials without having to spend too much time on fixing dependencies etc.

## Workshops

### Intro to HPC

The wbsite is [here](https://docs.cyfronet.pl/display/~plgnoga/NGSchool2019)

### Intro to R


### Intro to Python
The whole workshop will be executed in the Jupyter notebook. 

Requirements:
* `python3`  
* `Jupyter`  

See Conda instructions with `ENV_NAME` set to `into_to_Python`. 

### Bayesian Inference
### Natural language processing
### Reinforcement Learning
### Deep learning methods for genomics
The seminar hands-on workshop will be run in a [google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SRHe_SXmKeXImNBR6tnhFQ3eThM4-iZu). A google account is required though. Additional information can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/rschwess/tutorial_dl_for_genomics) but no need to install anything for the workshop.
### Deep Generative Models for dimensionality reduction
### Tree based methods

## Hackathons

### Dilated Convolutional Neural Nets for DNase-seq and ATAC-seq footprinting 
Requirements: 
* `python3`
* `keras` and `Tensorflow v1.14` as backend
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* google account for colab notebook work

Literature:
* [Dnase Footprinting general Introduction](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3768)
* [Learning genomic signals at base pair resolution](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kg6Ic0-FvJtVUva9Mh3FPnOAHJcN6VB-/view)
