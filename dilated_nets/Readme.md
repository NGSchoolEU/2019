## Dilated Network Hackathon :chart_with_upwards_trend:

### Outline

We will use dilated convolutional neural networks to try and predict DNase-seq and ATAC-seq footprints at base pair resolution from DNA sequence.

### A Notebook to get you started

All information, access to data and an example workflow to get you started are available in this [colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1q9Hzb_i3_zp2yMxVfi08gISlGzAyIKmQ). Please save a copy before editing!

### Requirements to run outside colab

* `python3`
* `keras` and `Tensorflow v1.14` as backend
* `numpy`
* `scikit-learn`
* please find the data download links in the notebook
